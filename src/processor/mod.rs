//! Processor pattern for tool-specific rule handling
//!
//! This module implements a trait-based processor pattern inspired by rulesync's
//! `FeatureProcessor` architecture. Each tool (Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf) has its
//! own processor that encapsulates all tool-specific logic.
//!
//! # Example: Adding a New Tool
//!
//! To add support for a new tool:
//!
//! 1. Add the tool variant to `Tool` enum in `fs.rs`
//! 2. Create a new processor struct implementing `Processor` trait
//! 3. Implement conversion logic (from/to AgentSync format)
//! 4. Add tests for the new processor
//! 5. Register the processor in the sync engine
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! pub struct NewToolProcessor;
//!
//! impl Processor for NewToolProcessor {
//!     fn tool(&self) -> Tool {
//!         Tool::NewTool
//!     }
//!
//!     fn convert_from_agentsync(&self, rule: &Rule<AgentSyncRule>) -> Result<String> {
//!         // Convert AgentSync format to NewTool format
//!         todo!()
//!     }
//!
//!     fn convert_to_agentsync(&self, content: &str, path: &str) -> Result<Rule<AgentSyncRule>> {
//!         // Convert NewTool format to AgentSync format
//!         todo!()
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// - Bidirectional format conversion (AgentSync â†” Tool)

/// - Rule file writing with tool-specific extensions
///
/// This trait provides a unified interface for the sync engine, making it
/// easy to add new tools without modifying the sync logic.
