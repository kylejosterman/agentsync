# Test Rule - Apply Manually

This rule is only applied when explicitly invoked (e.g., @test-manual in Cursor).

It should appear in:
- Cursor: Manual mode (alwaysApply: false, no description, no globs)
- Windsurf: manual mode (no description, no globs)
- Copilot: Available but not auto-applied

## Manual Invocation

This rule contains specialized instructions that should only be used when explicitly requested.

Example use cases:
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Security audit checklists
- Refactoring patterns
