# Test Rule - Apply Intelligently

This rule is applied intelligently based on context and description.

It should appear in:
- Cursor: Auto Attached mode with description (alwaysApply: false, description present, no globs)
- Windsurf: model_decision mode (description present, no globs)
- Copilot: Applied based on description

## Guidelines

When writing tests:
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Keep tests isolated and independent
- Mock external dependencies
